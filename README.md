# GameExpo
DV8 2022 Game Event (no longer called Expo) Website developed by Michal.

This website was made as a college project to show off peoples works, this will be archived as soon as the even is over.
Not much documentation is needed on this project, as this isn't made to be used by others. But feel free to use the broken code lol.

Want a fun fact? I had so much time to make this website, then I had to rush the end because I though I had an extra week to work on this, but I didn't...

## Legal
I do not own any of the logos displayed on this website. Also please don't take any jokes in the code seriously, this is for fun and nothing else.
